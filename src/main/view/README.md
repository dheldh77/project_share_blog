## Project setup
```
npm install
```
*Install node_modules in `package.json`*

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
*This command is used for development. The default port of Tomcat is `8080`, so I set vue to `4000`. For details, refer to the `script` in `package.json`.*

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
*The current build artifacts are stored in: `src/main/resources/static`*

*This is the default path where SpringBoot reads index.html.*

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
